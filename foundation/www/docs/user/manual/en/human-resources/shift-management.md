# Shift Management

**Shift Management** typically allows an organisation to divide the day into shifts, set periods of time during which different workers can perform their duties.
There are three DocTypes which enables you to manage shifts using ERPNext.

- Shift Type
- Shift Request
- Shift Assignment 

To create a **Shift Type**:

> Human Resources > Shift Management > Shift Type > New Shift Type

Configure the form as per your requirements, an example -

You can also set a **Holiday List**  for which days the Shift Requests won't be considered.

## Shift Assignment

You can assign shifts to employees using the Shift Assignment for each day.

Next, what's a **Shift Request**?

An employee can place a request for working as per her Shift preference as well as select the `From Date` and `To Date`. 

An example,

<img class="screenshot"  alt="Shift Request"  src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/human-resources/shift-request.png">

On submission of a Shift Request, Shift Assignments are created for the dates selected.

You can also see the Shift Request from which the Shift Assignments were created is also linked in the document.

Along with that, on cancelling the shift request, all the shift assignments will be unlinked and cancelled as well.
