Frappe offers two primary views: Desktop and Desktop Sidebar; Desktop is default view.

To change your Desktop or Desk Sidebar, go to:

 > Setup > User > Desktop

For the Desktop view, you can set the background image and fill style. The full width layout can be enabled in this view, but is not required. 

Desktop Sidebar is enabled on a per-User basis. When "Sidebar" is enabled, you must assign a homepage, but "modules" is given as a default.
